Fully Open-source LLM Tool

Thank you for reading this.

Actually, Zeta-Tool is a personal project. There are still parts that haven't been developed yet.

If possible, please help in one of the following ways:
1. Simple: Please give it a star.
2. For programmers/engineers: Help with code fixes or testing. (See [Ideas](Idea.md))
