> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am developing various projects, and since I manage, maintain, and update all of them myself, there may be times when I can't attend to each project individually.
> For example, large-scale projects like [Zeta-LLM](https://github.com/Zeta-DGC/Zeta-LLM) are very difficult to develop.
> [PyYPSH](https://github.com/YPSH-DGC/YPSH) is also a challenging project, as it implements a custom programming language using ASTs, which is quite advanced.
> If you would like to report bugs or suggest new features for my projects, I would greatly appreciate it if you could use pull requests and make them ready to merge, if possible.
> Also, if someone else has already created an issue, I would be thankful if you could create a pull request that immediately addresses the problem, if you're able to.

Thank you for reading this.

Actually, Zeta-Tool is a personal project. There are still parts that haven't been developed yet.

If possible, please help in one of the following ways:
1. Simple: Please give it a star.
2. For programmers/engineers: Help with code fixes or testing. (See [Ideas](Idea.md))
